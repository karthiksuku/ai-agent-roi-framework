**🚀 Introducing the AURA Framework - Open Source AI Agent ROI Calculator**

After months of working with enterprises deploying AI agents, I noticed a recurring problem: traditional ROI models don't work for AI.

Why? Because AI agents are fundamentally different:
• They improve over time (learning compounds)
• They enable work that wasn't possible before
• They create value across multiple dimensions
• Their adoption follows a maturity curve

So I built **AURA** - AI Utility & Return Assessment.

**The 5 Value Dimensions:**
1️⃣ Direct Labour Arbitrage (DLA) - Hours saved
2️⃣ Throughput Amplification (TA) - New capacity enabled
3️⃣ Decision Quality Premium (DQP) - Better outcomes
4️⃣ Latency Value (LV) - Speed creates value
5️⃣ Optionality & Learning (OLV) - Strategic insights

**What makes it different:**
✅ Maturity model (Pilot → Proven → Scaled → Optimized)
✅ Risk adjustment across 4 categories
✅ Industry-specific presets (Healthcare, Finance, Retail, etc.)
✅ NPV, IRR, and payback calculations
✅ Fully open source

**It's live on GitHub:** https://github.com/karthiksuku/ai-agent-roi-framework

Whether you're building a business case for an AI agent, evaluating vendor proposals, or tracking actual ROI - this framework brings rigour and transparency to the conversation.

Would love your feedback and contributions. 🙏

## Option 2: Shorter/Punchy Version

---

**Most AI ROI calculations are wrong.**

They treat AI like traditional software - flat value from day 1, simple cost savings.

But AI agents are different. They learn. They compound. They enable new work.

So I open-sourced the **AURA Framework** to fix this.

📊 5 value dimensions beyond labour savings
📈 Maturity model for realistic projections
⚠️ Risk-adjusted returns
🏥 Industry-specific presets

Python library. CLI tool. Full documentation.

## Option 3: Story-Driven Version

---

**"What's the ROI on this AI agent?"**

I've heard this question dozens of times from executives, and I've seen the same problem repeat:

Someone puts together a spreadsheet with:
- Hours saved × hourly rate = savings
- Subtract costs
- Call it ROI

But that misses so much:
- The agent improves over time
- Adoption isn't instant
- There are risks to account for
- Value goes beyond labour savings

I decided to build something better.

**Introducing AURA** (AI Utility & Return Assessment)

An open-source framework for calculating AI agent ROI properly.

The framework captures:
→ 5 distinct value dimensions
→ A maturity curve (Pilot → Optimized)
→ Risk adjustment (technical, adoption, regulatory, vendor)
→ Industry-specific defaults

I've included presets for Healthcare, Financial Services, Government, Retail, Manufacturing, and more.

It's all on GitHub: https://github.com/karthiksuku/ai-agent-roi-framework

If you're building business cases for AI, I hope this helps bring clarity and credibility to the conversation.

Contributions and feedback welcome!
