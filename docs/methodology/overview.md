# AURA Framework Overview

## AI Utility & Return Assessment

The AURA Framework provides a comprehensive, rigorous methodology for calculating return on investment (ROI) for AI agent projects. Unlike traditional software ROI models, AURA captures the unique characteristics of AI agents that improve over time, handle variable workloads, and generate value across multiple dimensions.

## Why Traditional ROI Models Fall Short

Traditional ROI calculations for technology projects typically focus on:
- Simple labour cost savings
- One-time implementation costs
- Linear value projections

**This approach fails for AI agents because:**

1. **AI agents improve over time** - Models get better with feedback, prompts get refined, and workflows optimize. A month-12 agent performs better than a month-1 agent.

2. **Value compounds** - As accuracy improves and adoption increases, value grows non-linearly.

3. **Multiple value dimensions** - Labour savings are just the beginning. Throughput increases, decision quality improves, latency decreases, and strategic optionality emerges.

4. **Risk is multi-faceted** - Technical, adoption, regulatory, and vendor risks all affect outcomes differently.

5. **Adoption follows a curve** - Value isn't immediate; it builds as users adopt and workflows integrate.

## The AURA Approach

AURA addresses these gaps with:

### Five Value Dimensions

1. **Direct Labour Arbitrage (DLA)** - Hours saved × loaded cost
2. **Throughput Amplification (TA)** - New capacity enabled
3. **Decision Quality Premium (DQP)** - Better outcomes from better data
4. **Latency Value (LV)** - Speed creates economic value
5. **Optionality & Learning Value (OLV)** - Strategic flexibility and insights

### The Maturity Multiplier

Value evolves through stages:
- **Pilot** (0.3×): Initial deployment, validation
- **Proven** (0.7×): Demonstrated value, growing adoption
- **Scaled** (1.0×): Full deployment, optimized workflows
- **Optimized** (1.3-1.8×): Continuous improvement, compound effects

### Risk-Adjusted Projections

Four risk categories are weighted and applied:
- Technical Risk
- Adoption Risk
- Regulatory Risk
- Vendor Risk

### The Composite Formula

```
AI Agent ROI = [(DLA + TA + DQP + LV + OLV) × Maturity × Risk Adjustment - Cost] / Cost × 100
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Accuracy Over Simplicity

We don't oversimplify. The framework captures real complexity because real decisions require real data.

### 2. Transparency

All assumptions are explicit. Every calculation can be traced. No black boxes.

### 3. Practical Defaults

Industry-specific presets provide realistic starting points based on market research.

### 4. Extensibility

Add new industries, adjust parameters, extend calculations. The framework grows with your needs.

### 5. Honesty

We include risk adjustment and maturity ramp-up. Results reflect realistic expectations, not best-case fantasies.

## Who Should Use AURA
